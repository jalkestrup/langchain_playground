Sensors of the probe design provoke what is called preferential flow where water from rain and irrigation is more prone to travel along the surface of the stick, leading to misleadingly high measurements.\\n\\nTDT Technology\\nMeasure accurately\\nTDT technology is along with TDR the only sensor technology that provides trustworthy measurements for irrigation scheduling. Trust science, not marketing. Our soil sensor delivers an unprecedented accuracy across soil types at an affordable cost. We take great pride in having scientific backing for our claims, and we are happy to provide you with the material.\\nAccuracy is not only about the variability in a laboratory setting. It is more so about how reliable the measurements are across different settings and environmental factors such as soil types, variations in EC, and soil compaction. Most other solutions rely on capacitive sensors that have proven unfit for this purpose.\\n\\nApproved by science, Trust your measurements.\\nWe only claim what research supports. At your request, we are happy to provide you with scientific validation of our claims.\\nIf you are considering an alternative solution, we will gladly help you compare it to ours based on scientific literature\\nUse the TDT technologyWhy is TDT a superior sensing technology? One of the reasons is measurement frequency.\\nSoil moisture sensors estimate water indirectly from the permittivity of the soil. The problem is that at the low operating frequency of capacitive sensors, the permittivity is not linear in all soil types.
