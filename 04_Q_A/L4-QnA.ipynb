Sensors of the probe design provoke what is called preferential flow where water from rain and irrigation is more prone to travel along the surface of the stick, leading to misleadingly high measurements.\\n\\nTDT Technology\\nMeasure accurately\\nTDT technology is along with TDR the only sensor technology that provides trustworthy measurements for irrigation scheduling. Trust science, not marketing. Our soil sensor delivers an unprecedented accuracy across soil types at an affordable cost. We take great pride in having scientific backing for our claims, and we are happy to provide you with the material.\\nAccuracy is not only about the variability in a laboratory setting. It is more so about how reliable the measurements are across different settings and environmental factors such as soil types, variations in EC, and soil compaction.
