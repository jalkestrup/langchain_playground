Reliable infrastructure. Easy to set up.Our devices are built for the future, using the latest technological advancements in low-power electronics. Not only is our system robust, but it is also easy to install. Simply add the sensors during installation via our app and we will ensure to notify you if anything requires your attention.

Proved in 8 countries on 3 continents
From a Peruvian desert to a Swedish winter. Our system is currently being used by farmers in Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Lithuania, Kenya, and Peru.

Off-grid capability
The SoilSense gateway can be powered by solar panels and the dataloggers simply run on standard AA batteries for years to come

LoRa wireless
Long range low power technology coupled with high gain antennas provide excellent coverage even in dense plantations, and metal greenhouses

Easy set up
Simply add the dataloggers via our app and have data flowing via our gateway in the matter of minutes

Maintainence free
Our equipment is designed to endure the outdoors, all you have to do, is replace the standard AA batteries in the dataloggers every third year.

Data 24/7
As a standard, our system automatically logs data every 20 minutes (adjustable) to ensure that measurements are always up-to-date

Free support
