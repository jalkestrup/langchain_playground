      "Predicted Answer: The benefits of irrigating correctly throughout the varied phenological stages of crops include:\n",

      "1. Increase yield: Proper irrigation at each stage of crop growth ensures that the plants receive the right amount of water, which can lead to increased yield and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Reduce risk: By irrigating correctly, you can minimize the risk of under-irrigation or over-irrigation. This helps in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels and reduces the chances of crop stress or damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Save time: With a system that notifies you immediately if the soil is getting too dry or if over-irrigation occurs, you can save time on manually inspecting the soil. This allows you to focus on other important tasks in your farming operations.\n",

      "4. Avoiding plant stress: Accurate soil-moisture sensors can warn you before the soil becomes too dry and starts limiting plant growth. By irrigating correctly, you can prevent plant stress and ensure healthy crop development.\n",
